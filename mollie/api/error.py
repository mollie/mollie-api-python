Deprecation policy

When a minor version release will be done, remove all code that triggers the DeprecationWarning subclass.
Then rename the DeprecationWarning subclass to the next minor version (RemovedIn24Warning => RemovedIn25Warning).
and rename the PendingDeprecation subclass below also.

This will make all existing PendingDeprecationWarnings change to DeprecationWarnings.

This deprecation policy is similar to what is used in Django and Django-rest-framework.
See https://www.django-rest-framework.org/community/release-notes/#deprecation-policy for details.
