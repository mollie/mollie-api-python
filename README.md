## Requirements ##
To use the Mollie API client, the following things are required:

+ Get yourself a free [Mollie account](https://www.mollie.com/signup). No sign up costs.
+ Create a new [Website profile](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/settings/profiles) to generate API keys and setup your webhook.
+ Now you're ready to use the Mollie API client in test mode.
+ Follow [a few steps](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/?modal=onboarding) to enable payment methods in live mode, and let us handle the rest.
+ Python >= 2.7
+ Up-to-date OpenSSL (or other SSL/TLS toolkit)
+ Mollie API client for Python has a dependency on [Requests](http://python.requests.org).

## Installation ##

By far the easiest way to install the Mollie API client is to install it with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io).

```
$ pip install mollie-api-python
```
You may also git checkout or [download all the files](https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-python/archive/master.zip), and include the Mollie API client manually.

Create and activate a Python >= 2.7 virtual environment (inside a git checkout or downloaded archive).

```
$ cd mollie-api-python
$ python -m virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements, then install Mollie itself.
```
$ pip install flask
$ pip install -e .
```

Run the examples.
```
export MOLLIE_API_KEY=test_YourApiKey
$ python examples/app.py
```

## How to receive payments ##

To successfully receive a payment, these steps should be implemented:

1. Use the Mollie API client to create a payment with the requested amount, currency, description and optionally, a payment method. It is important to specify a unique redirect URL where the customer is supposed to return to after the payment is completed.

2. Immediately after the payment is completed, our platform will send an asynchronous request to the configured webhook to allow the payment details to be retrieved, so you know when exactly to start processing the customer's order.

3. The customer returns, and should be satisfied to see that the order was paid and is now being processed.

Find our full documentation online on [docs.mollie.com](https://docs.mollie.com).

## Getting started ##

Importing the Mollie API Client
```python
from mollie.api.client import Client
``` 
Initializing the Mollie API client, and setting your API key

```python
mollie_client = Client()
mollie_client.set_api_key('test_dHar4XY7LxsDOtmnkVtjNVWXLSlXsM')
``` 

Creating a new payment.

```python
payment = mollie_client.payments.create({
    'amount': {
        'currency': 'EUR',
        'value': '10.00' 
    },
    'description': 'My first API payment',
    'redirectUrl': 'https://webshop.example.org/order/12345/',
    'webhookUrl': 'https://webshop.example.org/mollie-webhook/',
})
```
_After creation, the payment id is available in the `payment.id` property. You should store this id with your order._

After storing the payment id you can send the customer to the checkout using the `payment.checkout_url`.  

For a payment create example, see [Example 1 - New Payment](https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-python/blob/master/examples/01-new-payment.py).

In general, request body parameters for an API endpoint should be added to a dictionary and provided as the first argument (or `data` keyword argument). Query string parameters can be provided as keyword arguments.

## Retrieving payments ##
We can use the `payment.id` to retrieve a payment and check if the payment `isPaid`.

```python
payment = mollie_client.payments.get(payment.id)

if payment.is_paid():
    print('Payment received.')
```

Or retrieve a collection of payments.

```python
payments = mollie_client.payments.all()
```

For an extensive example of listing payments with the details and status, see [Example 5 - Payments History](https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-python/blob/master/examples/05-payments-history.py).

## Payment webhook ##

When the status of a payment changes the `webhookUrl` we specified in the creation of the payment will be called.  
There we can use the `id` from our POST parameters to check te status and act upon that, see [Example 2 - Webhook verification](https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-python/blob/master/examples/02-webhook-verification.py).


## Multicurrency ##
Since the 2.0 version of the API (supported by version 2.0.0 of the client) non-EUR payments for your customers is now supported.
A full list of available currencies can be found [in our documentation](https://docs.mollie.com/guides/multicurrency).

```python
payment = mollie_client.payments.create({
    'amount': {
        'currency': 'USD', 
        'value': '10.00'
    },
    'description': 'Order #12345',
    'redirectUrl': 'https://webshop.example.org/order/12345/',
    'webhookUrl': 'https://webshop.example.org/mollie-webhook/',
})
```
_After the customer completes the payment, the `payment.settlement_amount` will contain the amount + currency that will be settled on your account._

### Fully integrated iDEAL payments ###

If you want to fully integrate iDEAL payments in your web site, some additional steps are required. 
First, you need to retrieve the list of issuers (banks) that support iDEAL and have your customer pick the issuer 
he/she wants to use for the payment.

Retrieve the iDEAL method and include the issuers

```python
method = mollie_client.methods.get(mollie.api.objects.Method.IDEAL, include='issuers')
```

_`method.issuers` will be a list of Issuer objects. Use the property `id` of this object in the
 API call, and the property `name` for displaying the issuer to your customer. For a more in-depth example, see [Example 4 - iDEAL payment](https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-python/blob/master/examples/04-ideal-payment.py)._

```python
payment = mollie_client.payments.create({
    'amount': {
        'currency': 'EUR', 
        'value': '10.00'
    },
    'description': 'My first API payment',
    'redirectUrl': 'https://webshop.example.org/order/12345/',
    'webhookUrl': 'https://webshop.example.org/mollie-webhook/',
    'method': mollie.api.objects.Method.IDEAL,
    'issuer': selectedIssuerId,  # e.g. "ideal_INGBNL2A"
})
```
The `payment.checkout_url` is a URL that points directly to the online banking environment of the selected issuer.

### Refunding payments ###

The API also supports refunding payments. Note that there is no confirmation and that all refunds are immediate and
definitive. Refunds are only supported for iDEAL, credit card, Bancontact, SOFORT Banking, PayPal, Belfius Direct Net, KBC/CBC, 
ING Home'Pay and bank transfer payments. Other types of payments cannot be refunded through our API at the moment.

```python
payment = mollie_client.payment.get(payment.id)

# Refund € 2 of this payment
refund = mollie_client.refunds.on(payment).create({
    'amount': {
        'currency': 'EUR',
        'value': '2.00'
    }
})
```

For a working example, see [Example 11 - Refund payment](https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-python/blob/master/examples/11-refund-payment.py).
